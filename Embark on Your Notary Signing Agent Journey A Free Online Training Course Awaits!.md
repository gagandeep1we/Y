## What is a Notary Signing Agent?

Before diving into the training options, let's clarify the role of a Notary Signing Agent (NSA).  An NSA is a notary public who has specialized training to handle loan document signings. They act as an impartial witness, ensuring that all parties involved in a real estate transaction understand and correctly sign the necessary documents. This includes mortgages, deeds, and other legally binding agreements.  Their responsibilities extend beyond simply notarizing signatures; they must also verify identities, explain the documents, and return the signed paperwork to the lender or title company promptly and accurately.

## Why Become a Notary Signing Agent?

The advantages of becoming an NSA are numerous:

*   **Flexibility:**  Many NSAs work as independent contractors, setting their own hours and accepting assignments that fit their schedules.
*   **Earning Potential:**  NSAs are paid per signing, and earnings can vary based on location, experience, and the complexity of the transaction. Many experienced NSAs earn a comfortable living.
*   **High Demand:** The real estate market, even with its fluctuations, constantly needs skilled and reliable NSAs.
