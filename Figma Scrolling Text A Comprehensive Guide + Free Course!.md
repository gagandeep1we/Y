This article will guide you through the essentials of implementing scrolling text in Figma, covering basic techniques, advanced animation tricks, and best practices.  We'll explore various approaches, from simple horizontal tickers to more complex vertical scrolls, empowering you to create visually appealing and user-friendly designs.

## Why Use Scrolling Text in Figma?

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand the "why." Scrolling text offers several advantages in UI/UX design:

*   **Information Density:** It allows you to display a significant amount of information in a limited space. This is particularly useful for news tickers, announcements, or long lists of items.

*   **Visual Interest:** Static text can sometimes be boring. Scrolling text adds movement and dynamism, capturing the user's attention and making the interface more engaging.

*   **Interactive Feel:**  Even though it's a simple animation, scrolling text creates a sense of interactivity, making the user feel like they are interacting with a dynamic element.

*   **Accessibility Considerations:** When implemented thoughtfully, scrolling text can improve accessibility by allowing users to control the pace and direction of the information flow.

## Basic Scrolling Text Implementation in Figma

Here's a fundamental approach to creating a horizontal scrolling text animation in Figma:

1.  **Create Your Text Layer:** Start by creating a text layer with the content you want to scroll. Make sure the text is long enough to extend beyond the visible area.

2.  **Create a Frame:**  Enclose the text layer within a frame. This frame will act as the "window" through which the scrolling text is visible.  Ensure the frame's dimensions define the visible area.  Any text outside the frame will be hidden.

3.  **Enable "Clip Content":**  Select the frame and in the Properties panel on the right-hand side, check the "Clip Content" box. This ensures that the text outside the frame's boundaries remains hidden, creating the scrolling effect.

4.  **Duplicate the Text Layer:**  Duplicate the text layer.  This second text layer will be positioned to seamlessly follow the first as it scrolls out of view, creating a continuous loop.

5.  **Position the Text Layers:**  Position the two text layers side-by-side. The right edge of the first text layer should align with the left edge of the second, creating a visually continuous text string.  Slight overlap can sometimes smooth the transition.

6.  **Create a Component:**  Select both text layers and the frame.  Right-click and choose "Create Component." This will encapsulate the scrolling text setup.

7.  **Create a Variant:** Within the component, create a variant.  Variants allow you to define different states of the component (in this case, different scroll positions).

8.  **Adjust Text Layer Position in Variant:** In the variant, drag the two text layers to the left.  The amount you drag them determines the scroll distance.  The goal is to make it appear that the text has scrolled smoothly to the left, with the second text layer seamlessly replacing the first.  The end position should align with the initial position, completing one cycle of the animation.

9.  **Prototype for Animation:** Switch to the "Prototype" tab in the right sidebar.  Add an interaction from the first variant to the second.

    *   **Trigger:**  Set the trigger to "After Delay".  A short delay (e.g., 1ms) is often used to create an automatic, continuous loop.
    *   **Action:** Set the action to "Change to".  Select the second variant.
    *   **Animation:** Choose a "Smart Animate" transition. Smart Animate will smoothly transition the text layers from their initial position to their final position, creating the scrolling effect. Adjust the duration and easing to control the speed and feel of the animation.  A longer duration will result in slower scrolling.  Experiment with different easing functions (e.g., Linear, Ease In, Ease Out) to find the perfect look.

10. **Create Interaction for Loop:** Add a second interaction from the second variant back to the first, using the same settings (After Delay, Change to, Smart Animate).  This completes the loop, making the text scroll continuously.

## Advanced Techniques and Considerations

While the basic method is effective, here are some advanced techniques to elevate your scrolling text animations:

*   **Vertical Scrolling:**  The same principles apply to vertical scrolling.  Instead of positioning the text layers side-by-side, stack them vertically.  Adjust the variant's position in the Y-axis to create the vertical scrolling effect.

*   **Variable Speed Scrolling:**  You can create a more dynamic scrolling effect by varying the speed.  This can be achieved by using different durations in the Smart Animate transition for different sections of the text.  However, this is more complex and requires careful planning.

*   **Masking and Transparency:** Experiment with masks and transparency gradients to create interesting visual effects.  For example, you can use a gradient mask to fade the text in and out at the edges of the frame.

*   **Interactive Scrolling (Hover Effects):**  You can add interactivity by pausing the scrolling animation when the user hovers their mouse over the text.  This can be achieved using the "While Hovering" trigger in the Prototype tab.

*   **Performance Optimization:**  Complex scrolling animations can impact performance.  Try to minimize the number of layers and effects used.  Optimize your text by simplifying its content.

## Best Practices for Scrolling Text

*   **Use Sparingly:**  Scrolling text can be distracting if overused. Use it judiciously and only when it serves a clear purpose.

*   **Keep It Readable:**  Choose a font size and color that is easy to read. Avoid using overly complex or decorative fonts.  Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.

*   **Consider Accessibility:**  Provide a way to pause or stop the scrolling animation, especially for users with cognitive impairments.  Ensure the scrolling speed is not too fast, making it difficult to read.  Provide alternative ways to access the information if scrolling text is not accessible to all users.

*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your scrolling text animation on different devices and browsers to ensure it works as expected.  Pay attention to performance and responsiveness.
