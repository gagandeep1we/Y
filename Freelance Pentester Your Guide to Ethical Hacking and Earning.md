## What is a Freelance Pentester?

Their primary goal is to simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. By mimicking the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of hackers, they expose weaknesses and provide actionable recommendations for remediation. This proactive approach helps organizations strengthen their defenses and prevent costly data breaches.
