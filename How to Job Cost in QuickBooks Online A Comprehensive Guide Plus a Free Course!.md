## What is Job Costing and Why Use It in QuickBooks Online?

Job costing is a method of accounting where costs are tracked and accumulated for each individual project or job. This allows businesses to determine the actual cost of completing a specific job, which is essential for:

*   **Accurate Pricing:**  Knowing the true cost of a job allows you to set prices that cover your expenses and generate a profit.
*   **Profitability Analysis:**  By comparing revenue earned from a job with its total cost, you can assess its profitability and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Budgeting and Forecasting:**  Historical job cost data can be used to create more accurate budgets and forecasts for future projects.
*   **Project Management:**  Tracking costs against a budget helps you monitor project performance and identify potential cost overruns early on.
*   **Improved Decision Making:**  Armed with detailed job cost information, you can make informed decisions about project selection, resource allocation, and pricing strategies.

QuickBooks Online simplifies job costing by providing features to track income and expenses against specific customers and projects. It automates much of the manual tracking and calculation involved in traditional job costing methods.

## Setting Up QuickBooks Online for Job Costing

Before you can start job costing in QBO, you need to ensure your account is properly configured.  Here's how:

1.  **Enable Class and Location Tracking (Optional but Recommended):**  While not strictly required, class and location tracking significantly enhance job costing in QBO. Classes allow you to categorize transactions by type of work or project, while locations help you track costs by geographic area.

    *   Go to **Settings** (Gear Icon) > **Account and Settings**.
    *   Select the **Advanced** tab.
    *   In the **Categories** section, turn on **Track classes** and/or **Track locations**.
    *   You can also customize the class and location labels if needed.  For instance, you could rename "Class" to "Project Type."

2.  **Create Customers and Sub-Customers (or Projects):**  The foundation of job costing in QBO is linking income and expenses to specific customers and, often, sub-customers. Sub-customers represent individual projects or jobs for a customer.

    *   Go to **Sales** > **Customers**.
    *   Create a new customer or edit an existing one.
    *   For each project or job for that customer, create a **sub-customer**. Make sure to check the box labeled "**Is sub-customer**" and select the appropriate parent customer. This creates a hierarchical relationship between the customer and their projects.

3.  **Set Up Items:**  Items represent the goods or services you sell.  Properly setting up items is crucial for accurate income tracking.

    *   Go to **Sales** > **Products and Services**.
    *   Create new items for each type of product or service you offer.
    *   Ensure each item is properly categorized (e.g., Service, Inventory, Non-inventory) and linked to the appropriate income account.

4.  **Chart of Accounts Review:**  Review your chart of accounts to ensure you have appropriate expense accounts for direct labor, materials, and other direct costs. You might need to create new accounts specifically for job costing purposes.  For example, "Direct Labor - Project A," "Materials - Project A," etc.  However, avoid over-complicating your chart of accounts. Using classes and sub-customers is often a better way to organize project-specific information.

## Tracking Income and Expenses to Specific Jobs

Once your QBO account is set up, you can begin tracking income and expenses to specific jobs. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Invoicing:** When creating an invoice, select the appropriate customer and sub-customer (project).  Use the appropriate items to accurately reflect the goods or services provided. This ensures that the revenue is correctly attributed to the job.

2.  **Entering Bills:** When entering bills from vendors, select the correct customer and sub-customer.  Use the "Category Details" section to specify the expense account and, if applicable, the class.  This allocates the expense directly to the job.

3.  **Recording Payments:** When receiving payments from customers, ensure you apply the payment to the correct invoice(s) associated with the specific job.

4.  **Tracking Time:** If you bill for time, use QuickBooks Online's time tracking feature or integrate with a third-party time tracking app. Ensure that time entries are linked to the appropriate customer, sub-customer, and service item.

5.  **Journal Entries (Advanced):** In some cases, you might need to use journal entries to allocate costs to specific jobs. This is typically used for indirect costs that need to be allocated based on a specific formula or allocation key (e.g., allocating overhead costs based on direct labor hours).

## Generating Job Costing Reports in QuickBooks Online

QBO offers several reports that can be used to analyze job costs:

*   **Profit and Loss by Customer:**  This report shows the revenue and expenses for each customer, allowing you to see the overall profitability of each customer relationship.

*   **Profit and Loss by Class:** This report shows the revenue and expenses for each class, providing a detailed view of the profitability of each project type or category.

*   **Profit and Loss by Sub-Customer (Project):** This is arguably the most useful report for job costing. It shows the revenue and expenses for each individual project, allowing you to assess the profitability of each job. To access it:

    *   Go to **Reports**.
    *   Search for "Profit and Loss by Customer".
    *   Customize the report by selecting "Customer" as the "Display columns by" option.
    *   Run the report.
    *   Drill down into each customer to see the Profit and Loss for each of its sub-customers (projects).

*   **Job Costing Reports from Third-Party Apps:** Several third-party apps integrate with QBO and offer more advanced job costing reporting features, such as budget vs. actual analysis, work-in-progress reports, and earned value management.

## Best Practices for Job Costing in QuickBooks Online

*   **Consistency is Key:**  Establish a consistent process for tracking income and expenses to specific jobs and ensure that all team members follow the same procedures.
*   **Accuracy Matters:**  Double-check all entries to ensure that income and expenses are correctly attributed to the appropriate customer, sub-customer, and expense account.
*   **Regularly Review Reports:**  Periodically review job costing reports to identify trends, potential cost overruns, and areas for improvement.
*   **Use Classes and Locations Strategically:**  Don't over-complicate your setup. Use classes and locations judiciously to provide meaningful insights without creating unnecessary complexity.
*   **Consider Third-Party Integrations:**  If you need more advanced job costing features, explore third-party apps that integrate with QBO.
*   **Document Your Processes:**  Create written documentation of your job costing procedures to ensure consistency and facilitate training.

##  Beyond the Basics: Advanced Job Costing Techniques

While the above steps cover the fundamentals, here are some advanced techniques to elevate your job costing in QuickBooks Online:

*   **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Tracking:** Implement a system for tracking the value of incomplete projects. This is crucial for accurate financial reporting, especially for long-term projects.  You can use journal entries to record WIP assets and liabilities.
*   **Overhead Allocation:** Develop a method for allocating indirect costs (e.g., rent, utilities, administrative expenses) to specific jobs.  Common allocation methods include direct labor hours, material costs, or revenue.
*   **Budget vs. Actual Analysis:** Create budgets for each project and compare actual costs to budgeted costs regularly to identify variances and take corrective action.  This often requires third-party add-ons for QBO.
*   **Earned Value Management (EVM):**  For complex projects, consider using EVM techniques to measure project performance based on planned value, earned value, and actual cost. This is often done outside of QBO and imported.
