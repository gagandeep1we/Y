## Understanding the FTMO Challenge

The FTMO Challenge is a two-step evaluation process designed to identify skilled and disciplined traders. It consists of the FTMO Challenge itself followed by the Verification stage. Successful completion of both stages earns you an FTMO Account, where you trade with the firm's capital and receive a profit split.

The initial challenge is designed to test your trading skills over a defined period. You'll need to meet specific profit targets, adhere to maximum daily and overall loss limits, and follow pre-defined trading rules. The Verification stage serves as a final confirmation of your consistency and ability to manage risk.

*   **Account Size:** FTMO offers challenges for various account sizes, ranging from $10,000 to $200,000. Larger accounts generally come with higher challenge fees.
*   **Currency:** The price is also dependent on the currency you are using, the prices may vary a bit because of conversion rates.

## Choosing the Right Account Size

Selecting the appropriate FTMO Challenge account size is a critical decision. Consider the following factors:

*   **Your Capital Management Strategy:** Determine the percentage of your account you are willing to risk per trade. This will help you calculate the appropriate position sizes for different account sizes.
*   **Your Experience Level:** New traders should consider starting with a smaller account size to gain experience and confidence before scaling up.
