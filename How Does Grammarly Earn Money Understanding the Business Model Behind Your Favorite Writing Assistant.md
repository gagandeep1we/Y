This provides a taste of the value Grammarly can bring, enticing users to upgrade to a paid plan for more comprehensive assistance.  The free tier has several key functionalities:

*   **Basic Grammar and Spelling Checks:** This is the cornerstone of the free version, catching common errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and basic sentence structure.

*   **Accessibility Across Platforms:** The free version works across various platforms, including web browsers, desktop apps, and mobile devices, ensuring wide accessibility.

The effectiveness of the free tier in attracting users is undeniable. Millions utilize the free version daily, constantly exposed to the benefits of Grammarly and the limitations of the free version. This constant exposure creates a natural desire to upgrade to a premium plan, unlocking the platform's full potential.

## Grammarly Premium: The Subscription Driver
