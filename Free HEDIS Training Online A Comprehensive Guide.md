*   **Effectiveness of Care:** Measuring how well healthcare providers are delivering evidence-based care for specific conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma.
*   **Access to Care:** Evaluating whether patients have timely and convenient access to the healthcare services they need.
*   **Patient Experience:** Assessing patients' satisfaction with their healthcare experiences, including communication with providers and overall satisfaction with the health plan.
*   **Utilization:** Examining how efficiently healthcare resources are being used.
*   **Healthcare Costs:** Understanding the costs associated with delivering healthcare services.

## Why is HEDIS Training Important?

HEDIS training is valuable for a variety of professionals within the healthcare ecosystem:
